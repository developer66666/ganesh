<pre>Whenever we compare VARCHAR2 with CHAR we need to TRIM the CHAR value and then we need to compare with VARCHAR2 to get the actual result.
Always my manager say to use VARCHAR2 instead of CHAR
For reporting purpose we can use CHAR bcs we dont want to use padding like LPAD, RPAD if we use VARCHAR2 we need to use padding </pre>

	<p>Global Temporary Table is a Database Table that is created and hold the data temporarly for that session or trasaction.
	to create GTT in 2 types 
	
<li>ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS 		-- once commit all data will delete & session wise data</li>
<li>ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS 	-- Once left session data will delete.</li>
<p>
		-- table is not deleted		|  Fast Data Retrival
</p   >
<hr>

<h3>128. GTT Syntax?</h3>

	CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE test_tb (id NUMBER) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS;
	
	<p>-- Instead of creating table for each time i cant create GTT table and drop so we can use PTT
<hr>

<h3>129. What is PTT- Private Temporary Table?</h3>

<p>PTT creates Temporary Table once the session left or commit the table will dropped.
<p>PTT is 18c Feature
<p>ON COMMIT DROP DEFINITION			-- once commit table will be drop
<p>ON COMMIT PRESERVE DEFINITION		-- once session left table will be drop

<hr>
	
<h3>130. PTT Syntax?</h3>

<h3>132. Muti Table Insert?</h3>

	Multi Table Insert statement allow us to insert data into Multiple Tables using Single Insert Statement.
<ol>
<li>CONDITIONAL INSERT ALL</li>
<li>UNCONDITIONAL INSERT ALL</li>
</ol>	
<h4>	Types</h4>
	<ol>
<li>INSERT All</li>
<li>INSERT FIRST</li> 
<li>PIVOTING</li>
</ol>
	
<h4> CONDITIONAL INSERT ALL</h4>

<pre>
INSERT ALL
     INTO trg1_tb VALUES(id,name)
     INTO trg2_tb VALUES(id,name)
     INTO trg3_tb VALUES(id,name)
SELECT * 
  FROM source_tb;

</pre>
 
<h4> UNCONDITIONAL INSERT ALL</h4>

<pre>
 INSERT ALL
WHEN department_id =10 THEN
 INTO dept10 VALUES (name, department_id)
WHEN department_id =20 THEN
 INTO dept20 VALUES (name, department_id)
WHEN department_id =30 THEN
 INTO dept30 VALUES (name, department_id)
SELECT * FROM emp_tb;
</pre>

<h4>Restrictions</h4>

<p>Multi Table Insert can only Perform on Tables Not in View or Materialized View.
<p>We can do Multi Table Insert via DB LINK
<p>Sequence Cannot Use.
<p>Can use 999 INTO clasue
<p>Cannot use in Nested Table.

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<li>Reduce Multiple Lock on Table </li>
<li>Improve Performance </li>

<hr>

<h3>133. Materialized View? | Snapshot</h3> 
	
<p>Materialized view contains Data
<p>Mview Data is Read Only
<p>We can Create Index in Materialized View
<p>Mview Data is not up to Date
	
	<h4>to get upto date Data we need to do REFRESH</h4>
<ol>	
<li>COMPLETE	- Fetch all the data from the Table</li>
<li>Fast		- Fetch Only Updated records</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>134. Mview Syntax</h3>

<pre>
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name
BUILD [IMMEDIATE]  | [DEFERRED]			-- mview created and data is fetch and stored immediate | deferred data will fetch on first refresh
REFRESH [FAST] | [COMPLETE] | [FORCE]
ON [COMMIT] | [DEMAND]
AS
SELECT ..;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name_mvw
REFRESH FAST | COMPLETE
NEXT SYSDATE +7
AS 
SELECT * FROM table_name;
</pre>
<hr>

	
<h3>135. Mview Log?</h3>
<pre>
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON table_name WITH ROWID; -- PRIMARY KEY | ROWID
</pre>
<hr>	
<h3>136. Manual Refresh?</h3>
<pre>EXEC dbms_mview.REFRESH('mview_name','C'); 	-- F</pre>
	
<hr>	
<h3>137. Disadvantages of Mview?</h3>
	
	Data in Mview is not upto date. It has Last Refresh Data
<hr>	
<h3>138. Data is Not upto date Still we use Mview?</h3>

<hr>	
<p>While fetching Data from another Databse even VIEW will fetch each time from Axisdb.
    <p>So we Creating MATERIALIZED VIEW the Data  will take a copy from axemp_tb and keep in HDFCdb each time we fetch data it will not fetch from Remote database Axisdb it will fetch in local MATERIALIZED View.
    <p>While Creating MVW it Takes some memory but performance wise its fast.
    <p>When we need up-to-date record we need to REFRESH By FAST | COMPLETE.
    <p>EVEN its Outdated record in MATERIALIZED VIEW but depends on Business need we can REFRESH when we need.
    <p>Main use of Materialised View is TO Improve Performance.
    <p>No use for Creating MATERIALIZED View for Local Database or Current databse only we use for REMOTE database.
    
<hr>    

<h3>139. Have You CREATED or used  MATERIALIZED View in your project?</h3>	
		
	I know how to create materialised view and i  not involved in creation but in our project we maintaing some set of Existing MATERIALIZED View
	<p>we use to do REFRESH as per the Client request(manual refresh).
<hr>

	<p> **Composite INDEX - More than One column we create INDEX
	
	
<h4>B-Tree INDEX</h4>

<p>Binary Tree INDEX is the Default Index 
<p>It is Created in High Cardinality Column (column with Values Distinct)
<pre>	
Ordered List of Values divided into ranges (like order_id 1..25 | 26..50
along with rowid it stored in leaf node 
	
 i.e order_id

<h4>-- Where will you see Partitioning.</H4>	
<pre>
SELECT * FROM user_tab_partitions WHERE table_name ='SALES_TB';
</pre>

<h4>-- Where will you see size.	</h4>
<pre>
SELECT segment_name,segment_type,bytes/1024/1024 FROM user_segments
WHERE segment_name IN ('EMPLOYEES','DEPARTMENTS','LOCATIONS');
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>159. Advantages of Creating PARTITION</h3>
<ol>
<li>Increase Performance</li>
<li>Increase Availability</li>

<h3>161. Table Partition Syntax.</h3>


<pre>
    <h4>List Partitioning</h4>
CREATE TABLE sales_tb
(
    sales_id NUMBER
,   state_code VARCHAR2(20)
,   amount NUMBER
,   sale_date date
)
PARTITION BY LIST (state_code)
(
    PARTITION sales_east VALUES ('AR', 'DL')
,   PARTITION sales_west VALUES ('GA', 'HR')
,   PARTITION sales_north VALUES ('JH')
,   PARTITION sales_south VALUES ('TN','AP','KA')
,   PARTITION sales_others VALUES (DEFAULT)
);

</pre>

<h4>RANGE Partitioning</h4>
<pre>

CREATE TABLE emp 
( 
    id NUMBER
, name VARCHAR2(30)
, salary NUMBER
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (salary)
(
    PARTITION low VALUES LESS THAN (10000)
,   PARTITION medium VALUES LESS THAN (20000)
,   PARTITION high VALUES LESS THAN (30000)
,   PARTITION others VALUES LESS THAN (maxvalue)
);
</pre>

<h4>HASH PARTITION			-- Internal partitioning | Hash Algorithm</h4>

<h3>162. What is Exchange Partition?</h3>

<p>Exchange Partition swaps an Existing Table with a Partition.<p>

<hr>


<h3>163. When to Partition a Table?</h3>

<li>Table size should be Greater than 2GB.</li>
<li>We cannot Partition a Table with LONG and RAW Datatypes.</li>
<li>We can export | import each partition by mention the partition name with Table name.</li>
<li>Index Creation Possible.</li>
<li>We can do Partition on Existing Table.</li>

<hr>

<h3>164. What is Cluster?</h3>

<p>Cluster is a Schema Object that Contains data from one or more Tables. 
<p>Oracle Stores togeather all the rows from the Table that share the same Cluster Key.
<p>
<small>	
When 2 tables freuqently involved in Join Operations it requires some IO operations the data in 2 different memeory location it switch from one memory location to another memory location  it reduce the performance
<p>Better to Cluster the Tables. the 2 tables data stored in single memory location and increase the performance
</small>

<p>To Cluster the Tables we need to do 

<ol>
<li>Create Cluster</li>
<li>Create Index on CLUSTER</li>
<li>Create Tables</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>165. Data Dictionary for Cluster?</h3>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM user_clusters;
SELECT * FROM all_clusters;
</pre>

<hr>


<h3>166. Hints?</h3>					

<p>We can Provide instruction to the optimized to choose a certain execution plan

<li>INDEX_ASC</li>
<li>INDEX_DESC</li>
<li>INDEX</li>
<li>NO_INDEX</li>
<li>ALL_ROWS</li>
<li>FIRST_ROWS</li>
<li>APPEND</li>
<li>PARALLEL</li>
<li>NOCOPY</li>

<hr>


<h3>167. Nocopy hints?</h3>

<p>No_Copy hint allows plsql compiler to Pass IN and Out Parameters by reference rather than by Value.

<ol>
<li>Pass By Values (default)</li>
<li>Pass By Reference using no copy.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>168. Invisible Column?</h3>

<p>Oracle 12c allows a coulmn to be invisible. 
<p>Column does not appear in the table or SELECT * FROM query unless explictly referenced by name
	
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ol>
<li>Adding Invisible Column does not affect existing SELECT * Query</li>
<li>Hiding Sensitive data from user who do not need to see</li>
<li>Creating Virtual Columns that are Invisible by default.</li>
</ol>

<hr>


<h3>169. Virtual Column?</h3>

<p>Vitual Column is a Derived Column in the Table it retrieve the Data from Other Columns.
<p>It does not store Data Physically, Instead it retrieve the data at Run Time.
	
<pre>	
CREATE TABLE test_tb
(
    id NUMBER
,   name VARCHAR2(30)
,   salary NUMBER
,   annual_salary AS (salary*12)
);
</pre>


</h4> Creating Index on Virtual Column</h4>
<pre>
CREATE INDEX test_ind ON test_tb (annual_salary);

SELECT * FROM user_ind_expressions;				-- Column_Expression : salary*12

</pre>

<p> We cannot insert values to Virtual Columns 
<p> Adding Command to Virtual Column
<pre>
COMMENT ON COLUMN test_tb.annual_salary is 'Annual Salary for 1 year only';

SELECT * FROM user_col_comments WHERE table_name = 'TEST_TB';

273. Performance Tuning?

	1. Query Tuning 
	2. PLSQL Block Tuning


	Optimizer is bulit in database software to process the SQL statement in efficient method.
	It uses avilable statistics to calculate the cost of difference execution plan and choose the lowest cost.
	
	There are 2 types of optimizer 
	
	1. RBO - Rule Based Optimizer 
	2. CBO - Cost Based Optimizer 

	RBO - uses a set of predefined rules for execution (until oracle 9i uses RBO)
	CBO - uses statistics of data and system resources and estimate the cost of each plan and choose the best plan.
	
	Oracle strongly advice to use CBO bcs it is more flexible and apdative than RBO.
	
	
	* Explain PLAN

	* Normalization divide large table into smaller table and link them using relationship.
	
	List of Normalization
	---------------------
	1NF - First Normal Form		-- Each Table should be Single Value, Each Record Should be Unique
	2NF - Second Normal Form	-- Non Key Column dependent on Key Column i.e department_name, manager_id, location_id dependent on employees table department_id.

Local Index: Created on a partitioned table, each partition has its own index, 
			suitable for large partitioned tables for efficient management and query optimization.

Global Index: Created on a non-partitioned table, spans the entire table, s
uitable for small to medium-sized tables where the entire index can be 
efficiently managed as a single structure.

332. what is call by value and call by reference

Call by Value: Copies the value of the parameter into the function or procedure, 
				changes made inside the function or procedure do not affect the original value.

Call by Reference: Passes the memory address of the parameter into the function or procedure, 
					changes made inside the function or procedure affect the original value.

Cursor: A named private SQL area used to parse and execute SQL statements within PL/SQL code.

SYS_REFCURSOR (Ref Cursor): A special data type in Oracle used as a pointer or reference to a result set, 
	providing flexibility for passing result sets between PL/SQL code and client applications.

340. stats_gather

If DML operation is performed frequently in a Table Oracle Automatically Gather Statistics for that Table
If the Table is Not Performed any DML Operations  frequently we can gather statistics to improve the performance.

Stats gatherering is the process of collection information about the data in the database
This information is used by the Optimizer to choose best execution plan.

EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_table_stats('ENH_DB','TEST_TB');

341.Instead of trigger

342. view u can update syntax for updating view

343. What is Ref Cursor?

	Sys_refcursor is weakly typed ref cursor 
	sys_refcursor can use in function to retrurn

345. Diff Cursor and Ref Cursor

	Cursor 											Ref cursor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cursor is Static									Ref Cursor is dynamic 
  (single query )									(can use multiple query)
2. Cursor cannot pass as parameter for				We can pass as paramater to function/procedure 
Procedure/function 
3. Cannot return to client							Ref curosr can Return to client 
4. cursor can be defined in PACKAGE					ref curosr cannot define outside of procedure / function 
and can access globally across package

	No, Mview has Last Refresh Data will have 
	It will reflect after Refresh it will get error

191. In a table you are adding one column and that column to be partitioned what to do

		we cant directly add 1 column and partition 
		1. we can create new table with partitioning
		2. migrate the data from exisiting table
		3. drop the table 

192. If im going to update 1 million records if i got any error and how i will handle the error.
 
		1. Bulk Collect with FORALL and SAVE EXPECTIONS
		2. IN PLSQL Block we can handle using SQLERRM 
		3. we can Handle Errors using SAVEPOINT
		4. Creating Error log table

193. For fast refresh what predefined caution we want to do.

		1. Materialized View Log is exists
		2. Mview should created using primary key -- to track the changes
		3. Avoiding complex queries like sub query and analytical functions  -- only use equi join 

194. In refresh it is not taking fast refresh it is going for complete refresh what u want to do?

		1. Check the mview log exists and it is created with primary key or rowid
		2. recreate mview log	-- drop old log   DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON your_table_name;


195. schema A and Schema B is there from schema A u want to access data what u want to do?

	1. We need GRANT Previleges to SchemaB ( GRANT SELECT ON schemaA.employees TO enh_db;)
	2. SELECT * FROM schemaA.employees;
	OR if its is another db manager team will provide db link using dblink we access)

196. can we do DML or DDL inside the fn.If u use pragma autonomous transaction u can execute without any error.

	Yes we can use DDL and DML statements inside Function using PRAGMA 
	we need to Explicitly COMMIT or Rollback the changes 
	we can use error handling like SQLERRM 

197. I dont want to give the schema name or table name for accessing the data from the other table what can I do?
    -- SYNONYM


-- Distinct and Group which is Fast?

	Depends on Size of database
	
	If it is Small number of data Distinct is Faster
	Larger Database Group By is Fast

198. Supplied packages

	DBMS_OUTPUT
	DBMS_PROFILER

*) What do you think about in the meantime?
	Focus on Self Improments
	Stay Organized and plan
	Productivity Focus
	Team Collabration 
	


*) Are you a developer or support engineer?
*) Do you Work in which environment?
*) Is support ok for you?

*) Which region do you work for?
	
	Country?

*) How do you balance time?

	To balance my time, I start by assessing all of my tasks and prioritizing them 
	based on their deadlines and importance. 

*) What is the data type?
*) What are joins?
*) Which join is faster, which one is slower?

	INNER JOIN or EQUI Join  is generally the fastest type of join.
	OUTER JOINs (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) tend to be slower due to the need to handle non-matching rows.
	CROSS JOIN is the slowest, especially for large tables, as it generates the Cartesian product.

1. Self Intro

-- Collections and its type
	Collections is an ordered group of logically related elements with same data type 
	And we access with the help of Index value 
	It is a High Level Data Type 
	We Declare Collection by using Type definition
	
	1. PL/SQL Table or Index By Table or Associative Array 
	2. VARRAY
	3. Nested Table 
	
-- Materialized View

	It is a Schema Object
	Materialized View Contains Data
	Mview Data is Read Only
	Mview Data is not up to Date
	We can Create Index on Materialized View

-- In base table you deleted one column and while querying mview will it show error
	No, Mview has Last Refresh Data will have 
	It will reflect after Refresh it will get error
	we can alter Mview
	ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW test_mvw REFRESH COMPLETE;
	
-- Table partitioned and its types
	Table Partition subdivided large Table into small pieces of Tables. 
	When the Table size is more than 2GB we do Table Partition
	
	1. List Partitioning	-- List of Countries
	2. Range Partitiong		-- January to March | April to June
	3. Hash Partitioning	-- h1, h2 --- Oracle will maintain

-- AWR report
	Oracle collects database performance statistics like CPU, I/O, Memory usage, SQL statements execution time,
	Number of sessions, connections, 


-- Difference between cursor and Refcursor
	
	Cursor 											Ref cursor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cursor is Static									Ref Cursor is dynamic 
  (single query )									(can use multiple query)
2. Cursor cannot pass as parameter for				We can pass as paramater to function/procedure 
Procedure/function 
3. Cannot return to client							Ref curosr can Return to client 
4. cursor can be defined in PACKAGE					ref curosr cannot define outside of procedure / function 
and can access globally across package 

 
8. difference between local and global index
9. what is call by value and call by reference
10.In a table you are adding one column and that column to be partitioned what to do
11.Index and its types
12.Mutating trigger
13.One refcursor value can be passed to other refcursor value
	we cant directly pass 
14.cursor can be passed as a parameter in procedure
	No by using refcursor we can pass 


Round : 2

1. Self Intro
2. Department wise I want to give rank for employees based on the salary using analytical function.
3. Diff between rank,dense_rank,row_number
4. collections and bulkcollect
5. If im going to update 1 million records if i got any error and how i will handle the error.
6. exception handling.Predefined exceptions
7. oracle packages
8. materialized view how you will refresh.
9. For fast refresh what predefined caution we want to do.

-- In refresh it is not taking fast refresh it is going for complete refresh what u want to do?
	1. Will check mview log was created bcs for Fast refresh log is important if log is not will create 
	2. will check the primary key is Valid in base table 

-- schema A and Schema B is there from schema A u want to access data what u want to do?

	1. We need GRANT Previleges to SchemaB ( GRANT SELECT ON schemaA.employees TO enh_db;)
	2. SELECT * FROM schemaA.employees;
	OR if its is another db manager team will provide db link using dblink we access)
	
-- cursor and sysrefcursor

	Cursor 											SYS_refcursor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cursor is Static									Sys_refcursor is dynamic 
  (single query )									(can use multiple query)
2. Cursor cannot pass as parameter for				We can pass as paramater to function/procedure 
Procedure/function 
3. cursor can be defined in PACKAGE					sys_refcurosr can only be declared locally within a block
and can access globally across package 


-- stats_gather

	If DML operation is performed frequently in a Table Oracle Automatically Gather Statistics for that Table
	If the Table is Not Performed any DML Operations  frequently we can gather statistics to improve the performance.

	Stats gatherering is the process of collection information about the data in the database
	This information is used by the Optimizer to choose best execution plan.

	EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_table_stats('ENH_DB','TEST_TB');


-- Instead of trigger

-- view u can update.syntax for updating view.
	In simple view possible but have some restrictions like group by, expression, 
		analytical function used not possible 
	Colplex View Not possible 
	
16.Diff b/w proc and fn
17.can we do DML or DDL inside the fn.If u use pragma autonomous transaction u can execute without any error.
18.can we call proc inside the fn and viceversa.
19.I dont want to give the schema name or table name for accessing the data from the other table what can I do?

6.Create a PL/SQL package named "EmployeeManagement" that contains two procedures:

UpdateSalary: Accepts an employee ID and a salary increase percentage as parameters.
It should update the salary of the specified employee by the given percentage.
DeleteEmployee: Accepts an employee ID as a parameter. 
It should delete the employee with the specified ID from the "employees" table.

8. Create a trigger named "delete_dept_trigger" that automatically deletes 
all employees in a department when the department is deleted from the "departments" table.

9. Create a trigger named "log_employee_update_trigger" that logs the details of 
any updates to the "employees" table into a separate "employee_audit" table, including 
the old and new values of the updated columns and the timestamp of the update.

   In this case it is using sort merge join why?

10. SELECT * FROM tab1,tab2,tab3
    WHERE tab1=tab2 AND tab2=tab3 AND tab3=tab1;
   In this case why it is using nested loop join,hash join and sort merge join.

11. DECLARE
    v_entityname     rulesdbo.entity.entity_name%TYPE;
    v_entitytype     rulesdbo.entity.entity_type%TYPE;
    v_basecurrency   rulesdbo.entity.base_currency%TYPE;
    v_entityid       rulesdbo.entity.entity_id%TYPE := 'TEDLIST';
    v_entity_refcur  SYS_REFCURSOR;

BEGIN
    dbms_output.enable();
    dbms_output.put_line('ENTITY ID IS ' || v_entityid);

                             || v_basecurrency);

    END LOOP;

    CLOSE v_entity_refcu

In this u should store the values in one variable modify the code based on that?

12. Write a stored procedure of refcursor type and store and display it in a OUT parameter. 
13. U want to update a table you did not given any where condition and its not updating as a developer what you will do?
	
	Updating without where condition it will update all rows
	If it is not Production no problem bcs in enh_tb region we use dummy data 
	if it is production 
	Backup Table 
	Test in Backup Table
	

14. Normalization and explain
15.GTT what variables used



1.Tell me about ur proj and the issue u have faced
2.Employees   ----> emp_id,emp_name,location,dep_id
  Departments ----> dep_id,dep_name

for joining this two tables and to fetch the employeees working in department IT which one is preferrable Inner join or 
subquery.

3.what is clustered index and non-clustered index

Feature					Clustered Index				Non-Clustered Index
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Order of rows		Stored in the order 
						of the indexed column		No changes to the physical order of the rows

2. Number per table		Only one allowed			Multiple allowed

3. Storage				Data rows are the index		Separate index object with pointers to data rows

4. Use case				used for primary keys		used for columns that are frequently searched

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.Have u design the work by yourself or any support u will get.

In many of my projects, I have designed the work independently, 
especially when customizing PL/SQL queries and implementing backend solutions for applications. 
However, I also worked closely with cross-functional teams, such as frontend developers 
and business analysts, to ensure that my design met both technical and business needs. 
While I may have taken the lead on certain tasks, I recognize the importance of collaboration 
and often seek support for areas where additional expertise is needed.

5.Auto generated primary key column is there for that index will be automatically created.If so what index will be created
     UNIQUE INDEX
	 
	 

-- Atos Syntel

We have one procedure around 100 lines including one delete dml also is there. 
in front end screen we have process button whenever we click the process button 
it run the procedure and delete the entires in pre order table some rare scenario 
the delete not happening as a plsql developer how will you fix it and how to avoid this in future.


1. Will check the Exception Handling is properly raised and handled and create and log table and 
	trap the error log message.
2. will check the Delete satatement is properly written in WHERE clause and commit or rollback.
3. We can check if there is any Foreign key integrety constraints voilated.
4. Will check the table lock either the other session is accessing the table at the 
	time of deletion.  i.e V$LOCK  | V$SESSION | SELECT * FROM v$locked_object.
   otherwise we can use Explicit lock using for UPDATE OF and WHERE CURRENT OF using cursor.
5. if the problem with the code i try to debug the code using dbms_output.put_line 
	before and after delete statement or DBMS_PROFILER or DBMS_TRACE for debugging.
6. will check there is any TRIGGER for that table is fired before the delete operation.
7. will test the delete statement seperately outside of the procedure.
8. To avoid this issue in future we can handle the exception and error log table for audit and debug.
9. we can use the DELETE statement as seperate session using PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION.
10. we can unit test for all possible scenarios.
11. we can check performance load test if the procedure can handle excepted volume of data
	if the table is large we can use partitioning for that table. 
12. we can use FORALL for bulk processing.
13. we can ask front end team to disbale the process button after click and reenable after 
	process completed to avoid duplicate click of process button.
	

/* we have table name A containg primary key and Table B is child table and 
	Table c is child of b i want to delete the record from Table A how? */

1. Table B and Table c has reference foreign key columns to Table A 
2. Initially i check the dependencies of Table A either there is any other table has dependency.
	using user_dependencies.
3. Then i backup the Table A 
4. if we need to delete the Parent table A we need to alter the Table A using ON DELETE CASCADE or
	ON DELETE SET NULL. 
5. Finally i Delete the records in Table A


/* we have Table name called Product_reviews we have columns like product_id, product_name, review_rating 
i need Top 5 ratings? */

SELECT product_id, product_name, review_rating
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, product_name, review_rating,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY review_rating DESC) AS rating_rank
    FROM Product_reviews
)
WHERE rating_rank <= 5;


SELECT product_id, product_name, review_rating
FROM Product_reviews
ORDER BY review_rating DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;


-- we have order screen has multiple queries how will you check that particular query is slow?

1. initially i check the SQL trace using i.e ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;
2. using V$SQL and V$SQLAREA to see currently executing and recently executed SQL statements.
3. using performance Tuning method we can improve the query.
